<p><b>(Post Baccalaureate) examinations.</b></p>

<p><b>Sub: Regarding Promotion to next higher class under Pharm.D Regulations 2008.</b></p>

<p>Sir/Madam</p>

<p>With reference to the subject cited above, I am directed to inform that the subject cited issue was considered by the 89<sup>th</sup> Central Council of the PCI in its meeting held in April, 2012 which decided to clarify that :- </p>

<p>a) there is a provision for supplementary examination under regulation 10 of the Pharm.D. Regulations, 2008.</p>

<p>b) regulation 15 and 10 of the Pharm.D. Regulations, 2008 are interwoven and are to be read together.</p>

<p>c) hence the failed students of annual examination are eligible to appear for supplementary examination under regulation 10 of the Pharm.D. Regulations, 2008 and if the failed students of annual examination pass in the supplementary examination they are eligible for promotion to next higher class without loosing additional six months. However, failure in more than 2 subjects in the supplementary examination shall debar the students from promotion to the next year classes.</p>

<p>This is for necessary action.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully</p>
