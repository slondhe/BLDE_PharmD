<p>This has a reference to the subject cited above. </p>

<p>It has been brought to the notice of the Council that some Universities are not prefixing “Dr.” before the name of the candidate in the provisional as well as final degree pass certificate issued by the university in respect of students passing Pharm.D/Pharm.D (Post Baccalaureate) from an institution approved by the Pharmacy Council of India u/s 12 of the Pharmacy Act, 1948.</p>
